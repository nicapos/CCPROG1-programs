/*
You were hired by ABC Bank. Your task is to write a C program to compute the interest to be applied on time
deposits. The user is required to input two values, specifically: the balance, and the interest rate per annum (in
percentage). The program will then compute and output the interest amount, and the new balance. Example
interactions are shown below. The items in bold face represent the inputs from the user, the rest are outputs of
the program. Your program should display the same outputs as the examples: 

Example #1:
Input the balance: 100000.00
Input the interest rate per annum (in percentage): 3.5
The interest amount is: 3500.00
The new balance is: 103500.00

Example #2:
Input the balance: 250000.00
Input the interest rate per annum (in percentage): 5
The interest amount is: 12500.00
The new balance is: 262500.00
